        We developed a model whose characteristics predict whether a water is healthy or not.Here we have created a separate class for data preprocessing.
  We created a separate class for the model.
Since there are two different values in the Label column, we first used the KNN algorithm. But we used a different algorithm (Random Forest) because 
this did not give enough accuracy.But since this algorithm did not give enough accuracy, we rescaled the data, and then we examined the columns and
removed the columns with high variance.
